# addressbookdemo

A little project I started in late Dec 2023 after I'd just started working with a senior engineer, pair programming with him on a new C# application. I'd never written C# before, so it was a nice little demo project to help me get to grips with some of the basics.

This is unfinished. If I have time to work on it in future, I'd like to transfer to using a relational database instead of a csv for storing the addresses, partly because I also want to teach myself SQL.
